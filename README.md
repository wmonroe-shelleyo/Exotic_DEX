# Exotic DEX: Trade the Uncommon with Confidence

Exotic DEX is a decentralized exchange designed specifically for trading exotic assets, such as volatility indices and real-world event derivatives. Leveraging **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption technology** (FHE), Exotic DEX provides a secure platform where users can trade sensitive financial instruments without sacrificing privacy or security.

## Understanding the Challenge

In today’s financial markets, trading exotic assets often exposes users to various risks, including price manipulation and data privacy concerns. Traditional oracles that provide pricing data can be vulnerable to attacks or influence, leading to inaccurate asset valuations and potential financial losses. Furthermore, many traders are hesitant to engage with sensitive data, fearing breaches and unauthorized access, limiting their ability to operate in this lucrative market.

## How FHE Provides a Robust Solution

Exotic DEX tackles the problems of privacy and security head-on by utilizing **Zama's open-source FHE libraries**. Specifically, the price oracles are powered by secure aggregation of encrypted data from multiple sources, preventing any single entity from having undue influence over the price and ensuring that sensitive data remains confidential. Through the use of FHE, Exotic DEX allows for computations on ciphertexts, enabling complex asset pricing without exposing the underlying data. 

This innovative approach not only bolsters trust among users but also sets a new standard for confidentiality in decentralized finance (DeFi).

## Core Features of Exotic DEX

- **FHE Encrypted Oracle Data Sources:** Utilizing fully homomorphic encryption to protect pricing information.
- **Homomorphic Aggregation of Prices:** Allows for the combination of multiple data sources without revealing individual data points, ensuring price integrity.
- **Support for Complex Asset Trading:** Facilitates the trading of unique financial instruments, expanding options for traders and investors.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed for both novice and expert traders, making it easy to navigate the exotic asset trading landscape.
- **Privacy-First Approach:** Protects users' transaction and data privacy across all operations.

## Technology Stack

- **Zama FHE SDK:** The foundation for achieving confidential computations.
- **Solidity:** For smart contract development.
- **Node.js:** As the backend framework facilitating server-side operations.
- **Hardhat/Foundry:** Tools for compiling and testing smart contracts.
- **Web3.js/Ethers.js:** For interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.

## Directory Structure

The basic structure of the Exotic DEX project is organized as follows:

```
/Exotic_DEX
├── contracts
│   └── Exotic_DEX.sol
├── scripts
│   └── deploy.js
├── test
│   └── Exotic_DEX.test.js
├── package.json
├── hardhat.config.js
└── README.md
```

## Installation Instructions

To get started with Exotic DEX, prepare your environment as follows:

1. Ensure you have **Node.js** installed on your machine. You can download it from the official Node.js website.
2. Install **Hardhat** or **Foundry** as the development environment.
3. Download the project files into your local directory (please avoid using `git clone`).
4. Run the following command in your terminal to install the dependencies, including Zama FHE libraries:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

This will set up all the necessary dependencies required to develop and run Exotic DEX.

## Building and Running the Project

Once your environment is set up, you can compile, test, and run your project using the following commands:

### Compile Contracts
To compile the smart contracts, use:

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

### Run Tests
To ensure everything works as intended, run the test cases:

```bash
npx hardhat test
```

### Deploy to Local Network
To deploy the contract to a local Ethereum network, first start a local node and then run:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

### Interacting with the DEX
You can interact with Exotic DEX via the console, using the Web3 interface. Below is an example on how you might call a function to fetch the price of an exotic asset:

```javascript
const Web3 = require('web3');
const web3 = new Web3('http://localhost:8545');
const contractAddress = 'YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS';
const contractABI = [/* ABI Array */];

const exoticDEX = new web3.eth.Contract(contractABI, contractAddress);

async function getPrice(assetId) {
    const price = await exoticDEX.methods.getAssetPrice(assetId).call();
    console.log(`The price of asset ${assetId} is: ${price}`);
}

getPrice('VOLATILITY_INDEX');
```
